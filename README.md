# Student Performance Tracker

This project is a Python-based system to manage and track student grades using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It calculates averages, checks if students are passing, and provides performance feedback.

## Features:

- Add multiple students and input their scores for subjects like Math, Science, and English.
- Calculate each student's average score and determine if they are passing.
- Calculate the class average and provide insights on overall performance.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the files.
2. Run the Python script
3. Enter student details as prompted:
   - Input the student's name.
   - Provide their scores for three subjects.
4. The program will display:
   - Each student's average and pass/fail status.
   - The overall class average.
